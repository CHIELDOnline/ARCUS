"instrumental motives",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Instrumental motives reflect a self-interest perspective and are Those motives which give the actor a sense of control over the outcomes, thus determining their fairness perception.  Instrumental motives include broadly based social exchange theories, economic rationality, equity-based theories and the control model.","barclay2017motivated"

"moral motives",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Moral motives are shaped by duties, norms and moral accountability, which are all strong influencers of what people will perceive to be fair. This approach suggests an abandonment of self-interest, while making fairness evaluations","barclay2017motivated"
"relational motives",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Relational motives include people’s need to feel a sense of belonging to the group and can have a powerful influence on what people consider to be fair.","barclay2017motivated"

"cognitive processing: controlled",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Controlled processing efforts in the form of comparing one’s input to outcome ratio with a referent other’s (equity theory), or various procedural rules in one’s actions (procedural justice), lend a direct influence on one’s fairness perceptions","barclay2017motivated"
"cognitive processing: automatic",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Automatic processing and cognition, like use of experience-based heuristics (fairness heuristics theory), making extreme judgements and justifications in times of uncertainty (uncertainty management theory & system justification theory), personality traits (individual differences) and intuitive moral mandates influence and motivate fairness perceptions.","barclay2017motivated"
"affect: mood",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Affect can act as information, especially in times of uncertainty: people might use the “how do I feel about it” heuristic to make a fairness judgement. Also, positive moods enhance fairness perception and negative moods decrease fairness perceptions","barclay2017motivated"
"affect: individual traits",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Individual traits can serve as lens through which individuals perceive fairness of stimuli, influence how they experience certain events and also influence the way others behave with them, thus changing outcomes of events and thus fairness perceptions","barclay2017motivated"
"affect: emotions",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Emotions like anger, sadness etc can influence one’s cognitive appraisal systems which leads to fairness perceptions. Anger leads to negative perceptions of fairness.","barclay2017motivated"
"affect: emotions",">","cognitive processing","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Emotional states lend a heavy influence on the cognitive processing of information and thus, influence fairness perceptions. For example, anger leads to higher use of automatic judgements, whereas sadness leads to use of controlled processing.","barclay2017motivated"
"affect: mood",">","cognitive processing","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","Mood can influence strategies used to process information (direct access/ motivated/ heuristic/ substantive processing) and can also shape the content of the processing, including preferences for procedural rules.","barclay2017motivated"
"perspective: observer",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","The perspective of the observer can influence the perception of fairness of a situation as observers want to uphold moral values and avoid/ seek out specific treatment in comparable cases","barclay2017motivated"
"perspective: actor",">","perceived fairness","none","Cognitive Science; Applied Psychology","none","review","none","The actor wants to maintain a “fair person” image and also perceive her own self to be fair and thus will change her own actions and behaviours in order to perceive fairness and allow others to do the same.","barclay2017motivated"
