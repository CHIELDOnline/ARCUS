"demographics",">","fairness","none","Evolutionary Biology","none","model","none","The frequency of trading classes (proposers or responders) increases when the division of resources is biased towards them. Then, frequency stabilizes as payoff will decrease. This stabilization will happen exactly when payoffs are equalized","andre2011evolution"
"biological market: symmetry","/>","fairness","none","Evolutionary Biology","none","model","none","If proposers are limiting, every proposer is paired up and the equilibrium distribution is p = 0. If responders are limiting, then least generous proposers won’t have partner. In this case if there are more generous mutants, they will evolve and get fixed.","andre2011evolution"
"asymmetric payoff",">","fairness","none","Evolutionary Biology","none","model","none","Overall, the payoffs get equalized, depending on investment","andre2011evolution"
"responder competition",">","fairness","none","Evolutionary Biology","none","","none","Both fair offers and fair expectations evolve, when there is a large number of responders who are in competition for choosing a proposer. In this case, if a responder tries to assess too many offers, she might not get any interaction at all. So its better to create a minimum request, which they will be ready to accept without comparing further offers","andre2011evolution"
"partner choice",">","fairness","none","Evolutionary Biology","none","model","none","In interactions where nobody can change partners, the player with higher power will reap asymmetric profits. As soon as its possible to choose one’s partner, bargaining power plays a much lesser role","andre2011evolution"
