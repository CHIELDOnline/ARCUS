21 villages of the same ethno-linguistic group studied. Proposer offers varied substantially (modal offer = 50%) but responders nearly never rejected. 
Proposers and responders do not have coordinated expectations even at the village-level, suggesting that either fairness does not regulate bargainer behaviour, or UG does not reflect the fairness norms regulating everyday life. Thus, environmental factors might be more important than cultural ones in determining UG behaviour.

Multi-level normal linear models used with DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) used for model comparison.},
