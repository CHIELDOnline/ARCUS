This leads to the evolution of an equilibrium offer of 50% of the endowment","debove2016models"

In such cases, offering a 50% split of endowment allows them to lessen this possibility of rejection","debove2016models"

The selection pressure is thus, stronger on the latter. This can also happen if instead of noisy play, there are random mutations which keep introducing demanding responders","debove2016models"
