The module was fielded in 2018/2019 and sheds light on perceptions of justice for self and others regarding outcomes such as income, education and job chances. The report focuses on the normative views people hold on the principles that should guide the fair allocation of goods and burdens within a society, the fairness of incomes for self and for others, the fairness of life chances, and the fairness of related political procedures},
