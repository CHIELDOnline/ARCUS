Equal outcomes were chosen to be fair more often when the self was in a disadvantageous position; when equality was not chosen, what was fair for oneself was seen to be higher than was was deemed fair for the other. So fairness judgements determine proportionality, but distorted by an egocentric shift","","messick1979fairness"
